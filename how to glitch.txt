types of glitching explained:
    the program works by converting your file to either a BMP file of JPEG and glitches those file types.
    if the file is a gif or mp4 it will split it into frames of BMPs or JPEGs and glitch each frame and stitch it all back together.

glitch amount explained:
    the level of glitching is done in percent.
    the higher the percent the higher the amount of data is randomised.
    due to this at higher percentages for videos it might have less glitched frames.
    this is because the frames were glitched beyond use and are then replaced by the original frame instead.
